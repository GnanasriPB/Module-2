## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING 1 TO N NATURAL NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python program to print 1 to n natural numbers .


###  Algorithm

1.Begin the program.

2.Use input() to read the value of n (the upper limit) from the user.

3.Convert the input to an integer using int().

4.Display the message "Natural Numbers are :".

5.Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive).

6.In each iteration, print the current value of i.

7.Terminate the program.




### ðŸ§¾ Program

n=int(input())

print("Natural Numbers are :")

for i in range(1,n+1):

    print(i)

### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the Python program to print 1 to n natural numbers was implemented and executed successfully.
